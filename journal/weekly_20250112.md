# Weekly 2025-01-12

## Goals of Last Week
1. Build up a **home lab**: Configure CJBlue, router, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.  
2. Edit **config files** for vim, tmux, i3, and bash.  
3. Work on **Down the Pingu Hole**:  
   - Start reading *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk.  
4. Write a script **git_hub_sync**: Automate the synchronization of all GitHub repositories once a day.  

## Reflection

### Reading *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk
As part of the project **Down the Pingu Hole**, I started reading and working with the book *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk. Thematically, the book is very interesting, especially the interface between software and hardware/kernel, which fascinates me. However, I am unsure about how deeply I want to dive into kernel programming.  

On one hand, I feel there is a clear and definite boundary that could allow me to deliberately focus on either kernel or user-space software, leaving the kernel side untouched. On the other hand, the kernel is highly relevant for **embedded systems** and aligns with my desire to understand things down to their most fundamental elements.  

This week, I worked through the first three chapters of *The Linux Programming Interface* and engaged deeply with the topics it covers. Many of these topics are familiar to me from my prior self-study. However, I was able to fill some knowledge gaps along the way.  

### Learning Strategy
I am aware that I have created a learning plan with weekly goals to ensure focus and progress. This week, however, I did not meet my objectives. While I could push myself to adhere more strictly to my planned goals in the coming week to achieve "success," I learned something different this week that I want to pursue further: the joy of learning and following that sense of curiosity.  

Allowing myself to embark on an unknown journey, driven by a sense of joy and discovery, feels meaningful. Naturally, I didn’t achieve the specific goals I set, but on the detours, I discovered the delight in exploring the current topic and venturing into the unknown. I want to continue this journey.  

I also want to focus on actions that I tend to avoid due to an internal resistance. For me, this involves the **practical application** of what I’ve learned. In the coming week, I will concentrate on this aspect and familiarize myself with my own limitations.  

### Personal Insight
I recognize the opportunities that my journey presents. I have created a schedule to guide me, but I also want to use this year to discover which area truly excites me the most. Ultimately, this journey is about finding the one field that sparks interest, joy, and **passion** within me—something that inspires my mind to delve deeper and develop expert-level knowledge.  

## Goals for Next Week
1. Continue reading *The Linux Programming Interface*.  
2. Work on **practical exercises** derived from the reading.
