# Weekly 2025-01-05

## Goals of Last Week
- No specific goals, as I am starting this new project.

## Reflection

### Installing Debian as the Main Linux Distribution on Different Computers
- Added users to the **sudo** group: `usermod -aG sudo [username]`.
- Learned the difference between `su` and `su -`: `su -` loads a new environment with new environment variables (e.g., `$PATH`).
- Installed basic applications: vim, tmux, git, i3wm, geany.

### Working with APT
- Learned the differences between `apt`, `apt-get`, and `dpkg`.

### Writing a Project Schedule
- Created a project schedule.
- Sent the schedule to various people and companies, requesting feedback/information.
- Posted the schedule on Reddit and the Linux.org forum.
- Incorporated feedback into the schedule.

### Mounting and Unmounting Devices
- Used the following commands: `lsblk`, `mkdir`, `mount`, `umount`.

### Handling GPU Fan Issues
- The GPU fan of one of my computers was running at maximum speed by default. This issue has been resolved:
  - Source: [Fancontrol under Ubuntu 14.04](https://iandw.net/2014/10/12/fancontrol-under-ubuntu-14-04-resolving-usrsbinpwmconfig-there-are-no-pwm-capable-sensor-modules-installed/).
  - Worked with programs: `lm-sensors`, `xsensors`, `fancontrol`.
  - Used commands: `sensors-detect`, `kmod`, `sensors`, `pwmconfig`, `update-grub`, `fancontrol`.

### Starting the Project *"Down the Pingu Hole"*
- Explored the journey of a command: from execution to source code, to connected libraries, to kernel calls, to kernel execution, and finally to hardware communication.
- Example command: `lspci`.
- Collected information about the command.
- Retrieved the source code of the package the command belongs to.
- Read specific parts of the source code: `main()`, `fopen`/`fread`, direct kernel calls.
- Analyzed the makefile and configuration scripts.
- Used the tool **strace** to inspect system calls.

## Goals for Next Week
5. Build up a **home lab**: Configure CJBlue, router, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.
6. Edit **config files** for vim, tmux, i3, and bash.
7. Work on **Down the Pingu Hole**.
8. Write a script **git_hub_sync**: Automate the synchronization of all GitHub repositories once a day.
