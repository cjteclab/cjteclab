# Weekly 20250105

## Goald of last week
- no goal, because I start this new project

## Reflexion

### Installing Debian as main Linux distribution on different computers
- add users to **sudo**-group `usermod -aG sudo [username]
- difference between `su` and `su -`: `su -` load new environment with new environment-variables (eg: $PATH)
- installing basic applications: vim, tmux, git, i3wm, geany

### Working with apt
- Learned difference between apt, apt-get, dpkg

### Writing project schedule
- Writing project schedule
- Send schedule to different people and companies and asked for feedback/information
- Post schedule on reddit, linux.org-forum
- Add feedback to schedule

### Reading book "leise ueberzeugen"
- work out my strenghs and weaknesses
- write a summary

### Mouning and unmount devices
- using commands: lsblk, mkdir, mount, umount

### Handling GPU fan
- The GPU fan einer meiner Computer ist bei default mit maximaler Drehzahl gelaufen. Dieser Fehler wurde behoben:
- source: https://iandw.net/2014/10/12/fancontrol-under-ubuntu-14-04-resolving-usrsbinpwmconfig-there-are-no-pwm-capable-sensor-modules-installed/
- working with programs: lm-sensors, xsensors, fancontrol
- working with commands: senors-detect, kmod, sensors, pwmconfig, update-grub, fancontrol

### Start project 'Down the Pingu Hole'
- Understanding commands: From command execution, to source coude, to connected libraries, to kernel calls, to kernel execution, to hardware communication
- example command: `lspci`
- collecting information about the command
- get source code from package the command belongs to
- reading specific source code parts: main(), fopen/fread, direct kernel calls
- check makefile and configuration-scripts
- using the tool **strace** to check for system calls

## Goals for next week
5. Build up your **home lab**: cjblue, router, raspberryPi, arduino
6. Edit **config-files** for vim, tmux, i3, bash
7. Working on **Down the Pingu Hole**
8. Writing script **git_hub_sync**: Sync all git hub repositories once a day.
